    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><strong>Pozole</strong> is a traditional Mexican stew known for its hearty and flavorful profile, typically made with hominy, which are large corn kernels treated to remove their hulls. This dish is often simmered with pork, chicken, or beef, creating a rich, savory broth infused with the distinctive flavors of dried chilies such as ancho or guajillo. The result is a comforting and satisfying soup with a texture that's both tender and slightly chewy, thanks to the hominy. Pozole is traditionally enjoyed during special occasions and holidays, reflecting its deep cultural significance in Mexican cuisine.</p>
        <p>The preparation of pozole includes several key components: the hominy, which provides the dish's unique base; meat, which adds depth and richness to the broth; and a blend of spices and chilies that create its characteristic flavor. The dish is often garnished with shredded cabbage, radishes, onions, lime wedges, and fresh cilantro, allowing each person to customize their bowl to their taste. Whether it's the classic white pozole, spicy red pozole, or tangy green pozole, this versatile dish is celebrated for its robust flavors and communal spirit.</p>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Hominy:</strong> If using dried hominy, soak it overnight or as per package instructions, then cook it according to the package directions. If using canned hominy, simply drain and rinse it.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook the Meat:</strong> In a large pot, add the meat (pork, chicken, or beef) and cover with water. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cook until the meat is tender, which may take 1-2 hours depending on the type of meat.</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Broth:</strong> While the meat is cooking, prepare the broth. Remove the meat from the pot once cooked, and strain the broth to remove impurities. Set the meat aside to cool, then shred or cut it into bite-sized pieces.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the Chili Paste:</strong>Toast the dried chilies in a hot pan until fragrant, then soak them in hot water until softened. Blend the chilies with a bit of the soaking water to make a smooth paste.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook Aromatics:</strong>In a separate pan, sauté chopped onions and minced garlic until translucent and fragrant.</li>
            <li><strong>Combine Ingredients:</strong>Add the chili paste and sautéed aromatics to the strained broth. Stir well to combine.</li>
            <li><strong>Add Hominy and Meat:</strong> Return the shredded meat to the pot, and add the cooked hominy. Simmer the soup for an additional 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
            <li><strong>Season:</strong> Add cumin, Mexican oregano, and salt to taste. Adjust seasoning as needed.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve: </strong> Ladle the pozole into bowls. Garnish with shredded cabbage or lettuce, sliced radishes, avocado, lime wedges, and additional chili peppers if desired. Serve with corn chips or tortillas on the side.</li>
            <li><strong>Enjoy: </strong> Allow everyone to add their own garnishes and adjust the flavor to their liking before enjoying your hearty and flavorful pozole.</li>
