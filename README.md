## Description 
In this project we will use html to build a basic recipe website. This will consist of an index page containing an ordered list of 3 links of Mexican dishes. In each of the three links the first heading will have the dishes name followed by an image of the dish, the second will be "Description" followed by two paragraphs about the dish, the third is "Ingredients" with an unordered list of the ingredients. Finally, the fourth heading named "Steps" will be an ordered list of the steps needed to create the dish.
